# Modelling-brain-signals-using-nonlinear-regression

The aim of this assignment is to select the best regression model (from a candidate set of nonlinear
regression models) that can well describe the brain response to a sound signal. The ‘simulated data’ were
assumed collected during a neuromarketing experiment, during which a participant listens to
advertisement and their brain response is recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG is a
widely used non-invasive method to record the activity of the brain. Specifically, MEG is recorded from
the amygdala, a brain region involved in emotion processing. For the first 10 seconds the participant
listens to an advertisement narrated by a neutral voice, during the next 10 seconds another
advertisement narrated by an emotional voice is played. The regression model you are asked to identify
will measure the auditory-brain interaction and the effect of the emotional narration. The researchers
hypothesise that the emotional narration will evoke an increased brain response
